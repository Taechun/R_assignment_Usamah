## Introduction

In this project, we explore different aspects of data analysis using R. We cover techniques for inspecting data, cleaning and transforming data as well as visualizing data to gain insights. The project includes code, datasets and HTML output.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/ukabuye/Spring24BCB546_R_Assignment.git`
2. Install the required R packages. You can use the following command in R to install packages: `install.packages (c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))`
3. Explore the code examples and tutorials provided in the repository. Each section has its own folder containing relevant code and documentation.

## Data Inspection

The data inspection section focuses on techniques and functions for exploring, summarizing, and understanding the structure of datasets. It covers topics such as:

- Loading and importing data into R
- Exploring data dimensions, structure, and summary statistics
- Handling missing values 

## Data Wrangling

The data wrangling section covers strategies for cleaning, transforming, and reshaping data to make it suitable for analysis or visualization. It includes techniques for:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling and merging multiple datasets
- Reshaping data from wide to long format (transposition)

## Data Visualization

The data visualization section focuses on creating informative and visually appealing plots and charts to effectively communicate insights. It covers topics such as:

- Basic plotting with base R graphics
- Creating advanced visualizations with ggplot2
